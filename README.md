# BARACO (Batangas Railway Corportation)
<br> Batangas Railway Corporation (BARACO) aims to improve the land transportation system in Batangas. A C++ program will be created and tested to help train conductors calculate passenger ticket fares. This program will operate through a console (DIPA SURE) interface, streamlining fare management and enhancing efficiency.
